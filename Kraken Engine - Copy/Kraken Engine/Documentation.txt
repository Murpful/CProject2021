Objects:
	-Detail Objects:
	1.	DetailObject(texture sheet file, int x coordinate, int y coordinate, int width of object, int height of obect)
	2.	DetailObject(texture sheet file, int x coordinate, int y coordinate, int width of object, int height of obect, int source image width, it source image height)
	3.	DetailObject(texture sheet file, int x coordinate, int y coordinate, int width of object, int height of obect, bool animated or not, int total animation frames, int delay between frames)
	4.	DetailObject(texture sheet file, int x coordinate, int y coordinate, int width of object, int height of obect, int source image width, it source image height, bool animated or not, int total animation frames, int delay between frames)
	-Different Decleration Descriptions:
	1.	This is the basic construction, it will create an object from an image file, the width and height of the object 
		will not be scaled according to the source image, if your desired width and height is less than the source image
		the resulting image will just be a portion of the source.
	2.	This improves upon the previous decleration, here you add two arguments to give the size of the source image so
		you can make the image smaller with proper scaling.
	3.	This is the same as the first constructor in regaraurds to image formation, however, the object is animated.
	4.	This is a combination of 2 and 3, an animated object scaled properly based on the source image size.

	-Text Objects:
	1.	TextObject(font, int font point size, int color Red, int color Green, int color Blue, int x coordinate, int y coordinate, string text)
	-Different Decleration Descriptions:
	1.	a text object is declared, it has a font, font size, color based on RGB format, coordinates, and the text itself.
